### Packet Tracer - Use Telnet and SSH

## Objectives
    Establish a remote connections to a router using Telnet and SSH.
        Verify connectivity
        Access a remote device

            DEVICE   INTERFACE   IP Address   Subnet Mask
            HQ       G0/0/1      64.100.1.1   255.255.255.0
            PC0      NIC         DHCP
            PC1      NIC         DHCP

## Topology
    Describe the devices used:
        2 PCs (PC0 and PC1)
        1 Router (HQ)

## Configuration and Verification Summary
    Step 1:
        Verify that the PC has IP addressing and can ping the remote router by typing 'ipconfig' on the Command Prompt under "Desktop".
            Below is the output of the command:
                C:\>ipconfig
                FastEthernet0 Connection:(default port)
                Connection-specific DNS Suffix..:
                Link-local IPv6 Address.........: FE80::201:C7FF:FE9A:30C1
                IPv6 Address....................: ::
                IPv4 Address....................: 192.168.1.12
                Subnet Mask.....................: 255.255.255.0
                Default Gateway.................: ::
                                                    192.168.1.1
                Bluetooth Connection:
                Connection-specific DNS Suffix..:
                Link-local IPv6 Address.........: ::
                IPv6 Address....................: ::
                IPv4 Address....................: 0.0.0.0
                Subnet Mask.....................: 0.0.0.0
                Default Gateway.................: ::
                                                    0.0.0.0

    Step 2:
        Verify connectivity to HQ by typing 'ping 64.100.1.1' in the Command Prompt.
            Below is the output of the prompt:
                C:\>ping 64.100.1.1
                Pinging 64.100.1.1 with 32 bytes of data:
                Request timed out.
                Reply from 64.100.1.1: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=253
                Reply from 64.100.1.1: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=253
                Reply from 64.100.1.1: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=253
                Ping statistics for 64.100.1.1:
                    Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 3, Lost = 1 (25% loss),
                Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
                    Minimum = 0ms, Maximum = 0ms, Average = 0ms

    Step 3:
        Attempting to establish a remote connection using Telnet by typing 'Telnet 64.100.1.1'.
            Below is the output of the prompt:
                C:\>telnet 64.100.1.1
                Trying 64.100.1.1 ...Open

                [Connection to 64.100.1.1 closed by foreign host]

        The connection is not successful because the router is configured to not allow insecure Telnet access.

        Attempting to establish a remote connection using SSH by typing ssh -l admin 64.100.1.1. The password is 'class'.
            Below is the output of the prompt:
                C:\>ssh -l admin 64.100.1.1

                Password:

                HQ#

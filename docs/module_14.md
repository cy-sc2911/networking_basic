### Routing between Networks

## The Need for Routing
    As networks grow, it is often necessary to divide one access layer network into multiple access layer networks. There are many ways to divide networks based on different criteria.

        Broadcast entertainment
            Routers in the distribution layer can limit broadcasts to the local network where they need to be heard.

        Security requirements
            Routers in the distribution layer can be used to interconnect local networks at various locations of an organization that are geographically separated.

        Logical grouping
            Routers in the distribution layer can be used to logically group users, such as departments within a company who have common needs or for access to resources.

    The distribution layer connects these independent local networks and controls the traffic flowing between them. It is responsible for ensuring that traffic between hosts on the local network stays local.
    A router is a networking device that connects multiple Layer 3, IP networks, At the distribution layer of the network, routers direct traffic and perform other functions critical to efficient network operation. Routers, like switches, are able to decode and read the messages that are sent to them. Unlike switches, which make their forwarding decision based on the Layer 2 MAC address, routers make their forwarding decision based on the Layer 3 IP address.
    Anytime the network portion of the IP addresses of the source and destination hosts do not match, a router must be used to forward the message.

# Dividing the Local Network
    Routing is the process of identifying the best path to a destination.
    A router is a networking device that connects multiple Layer 3, IP networks. At the distribution layer of the network, routers direct traffic and perform other functions critical to efficient network operations. Routers, like switches are able to decode and read the messages that are sent to them. Unlike switches, which make their forwarding decision based on the Layer 2 MAC address, routers make their forwarding decision based on the Layer 3 IP address.
    The packet format containst the IP addresses of the destination and source hosts, as well as the message data being sent between them. The router reads the network portion of the destination IP address and uses it to find which one of the attached networks is the best way to forward the message to the destination.
    Anytime the network portion of the IP addresses of the source and destination hosts do not match, a router must be used to forward the message. If a host located on the network 1.1.1.0 needs to send a message to a host on network 5.5.5.0, the host will forward the message to the router. The router receives the message, de-encapsulates the Ethernet Frame, and then reads the destination IP address in the IP packet. It then determines where to forward the message. It re-encapsulates the packet back into a new frame, and forwards the frame on to its destination.

# The Routing Table
    Routers move information between local and remote networks. Routers must first use routing tables to store information. Routing tables are not concerned with the addresses of individual hosts. Routing tables contain the addresses of networks, and the best path to reach those networks. Entries can be made to the routing table in two ways: dynamically updated by information received from other routers in the network, or manually entered by a network administrator. Routers use the routing tables to determine which interface to use to forward a message ot its intended destination.
    If the router cannot determine where to forward a message, it will drop it. Network administrators configure a static default route that is placed into the routing table so that a packet will not be dropped due to the destination network not being in the routing table. A default route is the interface through which the router forwards a packet containing an unknown destination IP network address. This default route usually connects to another router that can forward the packet towards its final destination network.

# The default gateway
    The method that a host uses to send messages to a destination on a remote network differs from the way a host sends messages on the same local network. When a host needs to send a message to another host located on the same network, it will forward the message directly. A host will use ARP to discover the MAC address of the destination host. The IPv4 packet contains the destination IPv4 address and encapsulates the packet into a frame containing the MAC address of the destination and forwards it out.
    When a host needs to send a message to a remote network, it must use the router. The host includes the IP address of the destination host within the packet just like before. However, when it encapsulates the packet into a frame, it uses the MAC address of the router as the destination for the frame. Hence, the router will receice and accept the frame based on the MAC address.
    A host is given the IPv4 address of the router through the default gateway address configured in its TCP/IP settings. The default gateway address is the address of the router interface connected to the same local network as the source host. All hosts on the local network use the default gateway to send messages to the router. When the host knows the default gateway IPv4 address, it can use ARP to determine the MAC address. The MAC address of the router is then placed in the frame, destined for another network.
    It is important that the correct default gateway can be configured on each host on the local network. If no default gateway is configured in the host TCP/IP settings, or if the wrong default gateway is specified, messages addressed to hosts on remote networks cannot be delivered.

# Creating LAN
    The term local area network (LAN) refers to a local network, or a group of interconnected local networks that are under the same admininstrative control. In the early days of networking, LANs were defined as small networks that existed in a single physical location. Although LANs can be single local network installed in a home or small office, the definition of LAN has evolved to include interconnected local networks consisting of many hundreds of hosts, installed in multiple buildings and locations.
    The important thing to remember is that all the local networks within a LAN are under one administrative control. Other common characteristics of LANs are that thye typically use Ethernet or wireless protocols, and they support high data rates.
    The term intranet is often used to refer to a private LAN that belongs to an organization, and is designed to be accessible only by the members of the organization, employees, or others with authorization.

# Local and Remote Network Segments
    Within a LAN, it is possible to place all hosts on a single local network or divide them up between multiple networks connected by a distribution layer device. How this placement is determined depends on desired results.

        All Hosts in One Local Segment
            Placing all hosts on a single local network allows them to be seen by all other hosts. This is because there is one broadcast domain and hosts use ARP to find each other.
            In a simple network design, it may be beneficial to keep all hosts within a single local network. However, as networks grow in size, increased traffic will decrease network performance and speed. In this case, it may be beneficial to move some hosts onto a remote network.

            Advantages of a single local segment:
                Appropriate for simpler networks
                Less complexity and lower network cost
                Allows devices to be seen by other devices
                Faster data transfer and a more direct communication
                Ease of device access

            Disadvantages of a single local segment:
                All hosts are in one broadcast domain which causes more traffic on the segment and may slow network performance
                Harder to implement QoS (Quality of Service)
                Harder to implement security

        Hosts on a Remote Segment
            Placing additional hosts on a remote network will decrease the impact of traffic demands. However, hosts on one network will not be able to communicate with hosts on the other network without the use of routing. Routing increase the complexity of the network configuration and can introduce latency, or time delay, on packets sent from one local network to the other.

                Advantages:
                    More appropriate for larger, more complex networks
                    Splits up broadcast domains and decreases traffic
                    Can improve performance on each segment
                    Makes the machines invisible to those on other local network segments
                    Can provide increased security
                    Can improve network organization

                Disadvantages:
                    Requires the use of routing (distribution layer)
                    Router can slow traffic between segments
                    More complexity and expense (requires a router)

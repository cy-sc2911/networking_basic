### IPv4 & Network Segmentation
## IPv4 Unicast, broadcast and Multicast
# Unicast
    - Unicast transmission refers to one device sending a message to one other device in one-to-one communications.
    - A unicast packet has a destination IP address that is a unicast address which goes to a single recipient. A source IP address can only be a unicast address, because the packet can only originate from a single source. This is regardless of whether the destination IP address is a unicast, broadcast, or multicast.
    - IPv4 unicast host addresses are in the address range of 1.1.1.1 to 223.255.255.255. However, within this range are many addresses that are reserved for special purposes.

# Broadcast
    - Broadcast transmission refers to a device sending a message to all devices on a network in one-to-all communications.
    - A broadcast packet has a destination IP address with all ones (1s) in the host portion, or 32 one (1) bits.

    Note: IPv4 uses broadcast packets. However, there are no broadcast packets with IPv6.

    - A broadcast packet must be processed by all devices in the same broadcast domain. A broadcast domain identifies all hosts on the same network segment. A broadcast may be directed or limited. A directed broadcast is sent to all hosts on a specific network.
    - Broadcast packets use resources on the network and make every receiving host on the network process the packet. Therefore, broadcast traffic should be limited so that it does not adversely affect the performance of the network or devices. Because routers separate broadcast domains, subdividing networks can improve network performance by eliminating excessive broadcast traffic.

# Multicast
    - Multicast transmission reduces traffic by allowing a host to send a single packet to a selected set of hosts that subscribe to a multicast group.
    - A multicast packet is a packet with a destination IP address that is a multicast address. IPv4 has reserved the 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 addresses as a multicast range.
    - Hosts that receive particular multicast packets are called multicast clients. The multicast clients use services requested by a client program to subscribe to the multicast group.
    - Each multicast group is presented by a single IPv4 multicast destination address. When an IPv4 host subscribes to a multicast group, the host processes packets addressed to this multicast address, and packets addressed to its uniquely allocated unicast address.
    - Routing protocols such as OSPF use multicast transmission.
        - Examples, routers enabled with OSPF communicate with each other using the reserved OSPF multicast address 224.0.0.5. Only devices enabled with OSPF will process these packets with 224.0.0.5 as the destination IPv4 address. ALl other devices will ignore these packets.

## Types of IPv4 addresses
# Public and Private IPv4 addresses
    - Public IPV4 addresses are address which are globally routed between internet service provider (ISP) routers. However, not all available IPv4 addresses can be used on the internet. There are blocks of addressed called private addresses that are used by most organizations to assign IPv4 addresses to internal hosts.
    - In the mid- 1990s, with the introduction of the World Wide Web (WWW), private IPv4 addresses were introduced because of the depletion of IPv4 address space. Private IPv4 addresses are not unique and can be used internally within any network.

    Note: The long-term solution to IPv4 address depletion was IPv6.

    Network Addresses and Prefix   |   RFC 1918 Private Address Range
    10.0.0.0/8                     |   10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
    172.16.0.0/12                  |   171.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
    192.168.0.0/16                 |   192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

    Note: Private addresses are defined in RFC 1918 and sometimes referred to as RFC 1918 address space.

# Routing to the Internet
    Private IPv4 Addresses and Network Address Translation (NAT)
        - Most internal networks, from large enterprises to home networks, use private IPv4 addresses for addressing all internal devices (intranet) including hosts and routers. However, private addresses are not globally routable.
    - Packets with a private address must be filtered(discarded) or translated to a public address before forwarding the packet to an ISP.
    - Before the ISP can forward this packet, it must translate the source IPv4 address, which is a private address, to a public IPv4 address using Network Address Translation (NAT). NAT is used to translate between private IPv4 and public IPv4 addresses. This is usually done on the router that connects the internal network to the ISP network. Private IPv4 addresses in the organization's intranet will be translated to public IPv4 addresses before routing to the internet.

# Special Use IPv4 Addresses
    - There are certain addresses, such as network address and broadcast address, that cannot be assigned to hosts. There are also special addresses that can be assigned to hosts, but with restrictions on how those hosts can interact within the network.

### Network Testing Utilities

## Troubleshooting Commands
# ipconfig Command
    When a device does not get an IP address, or has an incorrect IP configuration, it cannot communicate on the network or access the internet. On Windows device, the IP configuration information can be viewed with the 'ipconfig' command at the command prompt. The 'ipconfig' command has several options that are helpful including, '/all', '/release', and '/renew'.

        ipconfig
            The 'ipconfig' command is used to display the current IP configuration information for a host. Issuing this command from the command prompt will display the basic configuration information including IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway.

        /all
            The command 'ipconfig /all' displays additional information including the MAC address, IP addresses of the default gateway, and the DNS servers. It also indicates if DHCP is enabled, the DHCP server address, and lease information.
            How can this assit in the troubleshooting process? Without an appropriate IP configuration, a host cannot participate in communications on a network. If the host does not know the location of the DNS server, it cannot translate names into IP addresses.

        ipconfig /release and ipconfig /renew
            If IP addressing information is assigned dynamically, the command 'ipconfig release' will release the current DHCP bindings. 'ipconfig /renew' will reqyest fresh configuration information from the DHCP server. A host may contain faulty or outdated IP configuration information and a simple renewal of this information is all that is required to regain connectivity.
            If, after releasing the IP configuration, the host is unable to obtain fresh information from the DHCP server, it could be that there is no connectivity. Verify that the NIC has an illuminated link light, indicating that it has a physical connections to the network. If this does not solve the proble, it may be an issue with the DHCP server or network connections to the DHCP server.

# The ping Command
    Probably the most commonly used network utility is 'ping'. Most IP enabled devices support some form of the 'ping' command in order to test whether or not network devices are reachable through the IP network.
    If the IP configuration appears to be correctly configured on the local host, next, test network connectivity by using ping. The 'ping' command can be followed by either an IP address or the name of a destination host.
    When a ping is sent to an IP address, a packet known as an echo request is sent across the network to the IP address specified. If the destination host receives the echo request, it responds with a packet known as an echo reply. If the source receives the echo reply, connectivity is verifies by the reply from the specific IP address. The ping is not successful if a message such as a request timed out or general failure appears.
    If a ping to the IP address succeeds, but a ping to the name does not, there is most likely a problem with DNS.

# Ping Results
    If 'ping' commands to both the name and IP address are successful, but the user is still unable to access the application, then the problem most likely resides in the application on the destination host.
    If neither ping is successful, then network connectivity along the path to the destination is most likely the problem. If this occurs, it is common practice to ping the default gateway. If the ping to the default gateway is successful, the problem is not local. If the ping to the default gateway fails, the problem resides on the local network.
    In some cases, the ping may fail but network connectivity is not the problem. A ping may fail due to the firewall on the sending or receiving device, or a router along the path that is blocking the pings.
    The basic 'ping' command usually issues four echoes and waits for the replies to each one. It can, however, be modified to increase its usefulness. The options listed below display additional features availble.
        C:\> ping
        Usage: ping [-t] [-a] [-n count] [-l size] [-f] [-i TTL] [-v TOS]
                    [-r count] [-s count] [[-j host-list] | [-k host-list]]
                    [-w timeout] [-R] [-S srcaddr] [-c compartment] [-p]
                    [-4] [-6] target_name
        Options:
            -t             Ping the specified host until stopped.
                        To see statistics and continue - type Control-Break;
                        To stop - type Control-C.
            -a             Resolve addresses to hostnames.
            -n count       Number of echo requests to send.
            -l size        Send buffer size.
            -f             Set Don't Fragment flag in packet (IPv4-only).
            -i TTL         Time To Live.
            -v TOS         Type Of Service (IPv4-only. This setting has been deprecated
                        and has no effect on the type of service field in the IP
                        Header).
            -r count       Record route for count hops (IPv4-only).
            -s count       Timestamp for count hops (IPv4-only).
            -j host-list   Loose source route along host-list (IPv4-only).
            -k host-list   Strict source route along host-list (IPv4-only).
            -w timeout     Timeout in milliseconds to wait for each reply.
            -R             Use routing header to test reverse route also (IPv6-only).
                        Per RFC 5095 the use of this routing header has been
                        deprecated. Some systems may drop echo requests if
                        deprecated. Some systems may drop echo requests if
            -S srcaddr     Source address to use.
            -c compartment Routing compartment identifier.
            -p             Ping a Hyper-V Network Virtualization provider address.
            -4             Force using IPv4.
            -6             Force using IPv6.

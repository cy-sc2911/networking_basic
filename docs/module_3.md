### WIRELESS & MOBILE NETWORKS
## Wireless Networks
- Mobile phones use radio waves to transmit voice signals to antennas mounted on towers located in specific
    geographic areas. When a telephone call is made, the voice signals is relayed from one tower to another tower until it is delivered to its destination. It is also used to send messages directly from the phone.
- The most common type of cellular telephone network is called a GSM network. The abbreviations 3G, 4G, 4G-LTE, and
    5G are used to describe enhanced cell phone networks that are optimized for the fast transmission of data.

# Types of wireless networks
- GPS (Global Positioning System)
    - The GPS uses satellites to transmit signals that cover the glob. The smartphone can receive these signals and calculate the phone's location to an accuracy of within 10 meters.

- Wi-Fi
    - Wi-Fi transmitters and receivers located within the smartphone enable the phone to connect to lcoal networks and the internet. In order to
    receive and send data on a Wi-Fi network, the phone needs to be within the range of the signal from a wireless network access point. Wi-Fi
    networks are usually privately owned but often provide guest or public access hotspots. A hotspot is an area where Wi-Fi signals are available.
    Wi-Fi network connections on the phone are similar to the network connections on a laptop computer.

- Bluetooth
    - Bluetooth is a low-power, shorter range wireless technology that is intended to replace wired connectivity for accessories such as speakers, headphones, and microphones. Bluetooht can also be used to connect smartwatch to smartphone. Because bluetooth technologu can be used to transmit both data and voice, it can be used to create small local networks. Bluetooth is wireless technology that allows devices to communicate over short distances. Multiple devices can be connected at the same time with Bluetooth.

- NFC (Near Field Communication)
    - NFC is a wireless communication technology that enables data to be exchanged by devices that are in very close proximity to each other, usually less than a few centimeters. For example, NFC can be used to connect a smartphone and a payment system. NFC uses electromagnetic fields to transmit data.

## Mobile Device Connectivity
# Mobile Devices and Wi-Fi
- Almost all mobile devices are capable of connecting to Wi-Fi networks. These precautions should be taken to protect Wi-Fi communications on mobile devices:
        - Never send login or password information using unencrypted text (plaintext).
        - Use a VPN connection when possible if you are sending sensitive data.
        - Enable security on home networks.
        - Use WPA2 or higher encryption for security.

# Configure Mobile Wi-Fi Connectivity
- Two of the most popular operating systems for mobile devices are Android and Apple iOS. Each of these OS has
    settings that enable you to configure your device to connect to wireless networks, Android Wi-Fi Switch and IOS
    Wi-Fi Switch.

# Configure Cellular Data Settings
- Cellular data plans are offered by most cell phone carriers, but the bandwidth limitations and charges for usage
    vary widely by carrier, and by plan within carriers. As a result, many mobile device users only use their cellular data plans when Wi-Fi service is not available.

# Simple Connectivity with Bluetooth
- Bluetooth technology provides a simple way for mobile devices to connect to each other and to wireless
    accessories. Bluetooh is wireless, automatic, and use very little power which helps conserve battery life. Up to eight Bluetooth devices can be connected together at any one time.

    Examples of how devices use Bluetooth:
    - Hands-free headset
        - A small earpiece with a microphone can be used for making and receiving calls.
    - Keyboard or mouse
        - A keyboard or mouse can be connected to a mobile device to make input easier.
    - Stereo control
        - A mobile device can connect to a home or car stereo to play music.
    - Car speakerphone
        - A device that contains a speaker and a microphone can be used for making and receiving calls.
    - Tethering
        - A mobile device can connect to another mobile device or computer to share a network connection. Tethering
            can also be performed with a Wi-Fi connection or a cable connection such as USB.
    - Mobile speaker
        - Portable speakers can connect to a mobile devices to provide high-quality audio without a stereo system.

### Module 3: Wireless and Mobile Networks

## Wireless Networks
# Types of wireless networks
- GPS (Global Positioning System)
    - The GPS uses satellites to transmit signals that cover the glob. The smartphone can receive these signals and calculate the phone's location to an accuracy of within 10 meters.

- Wi-Fi
    - Wi-Fi transmitters and receivers located within the smartphone enable the phone to connect to lcoal networks and the internet. In order to
    receive and send data on a Wi-Fi network, the phone needs to be within the range of the signal from a wireless network access point. Wi-Fi
    networks are usually privately owned but often provide guest or public access hotspots. A hotspot is an area where Wi-Fi signals are available.
    Wi-Fi network connections on the phone are similar to the network connections on a laptop computer.

- Bluetooth
    - Bluetooth is a low-power, shorter range wireless technology that is intended to replace wired connectivity for accessories such as speakers, headphones, and microphones. Bluetooht can also be used to connect smartwatch to smartphone. Because bluetooth technologu can be used to transmit both data and voice, it can be used to create small local networks. Bluetooth is wireless technology that allows devices to communicate over short distances. Multiple devices can be connected at the same time with Bluetooth.

- NFC (Near Field Communication)
    - NFC is a wireless communication technology that enables data to be exchanged by devices that are in very close proximity to each other, usually less than a few centimeters. For example, NFC can be used to connect a smartphone and a payment system. NFC uses electromagnetic fields to transmit data.

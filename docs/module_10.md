### IPv6 Addressing Formats and Rules
## IPv4 Issues
    (Regional Internet Registry) RIR IPv4 Exhaustion Dates
        - IPv6 is designed to be the successor to IPv4. IPv6 has a larger 128-bit address space, providing 340 undecillion (i.e., 340 followed by zeroes) possibles addresses. However, IPv6 is more than just larger addresses.
        - When the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) began its development of a successor to IPv4, it used this opportunity to fix the limitations of IPv4 and include enhancements. One example is Internet Control Message Protocol version 6 (ICMPv6), which includes address resolution and address autoconfiguration not found in ICMP for IPv4 (ICMPv4).
        - The depletion of IPv4 address space has been the motivating factor for moving to IPv6. As Africe, Asia and other areas of the world become more connected to the internet, there are not enough IPv4 addresses to accomodate this growth.
        - IPv4 has a theoretical maximum of 4.3 billion addresses. Private addresses in combination with Network Address Translation (NAT) have been instrumental in slwoing the depletion of IPv4 address space. However, NAT is problematic for many applications, creates latency and has limitations that severely impede peer-to-peer communications.
        - With the ever-increasing number of mobile devices, mobile providers habe been leading the way with the transition to IPv6. The top two mobile providers in the United States report that over 90% of their traffic is over IPv6.
        - Most top ISPs and content providers such as Youtube, Facebook, and Netflix, has also made the transition. Many companies like Microsoft, Facebook, and LinkedIn are transitioning to IPv6-only internally. In 2018, broadcast ISP Comcast reported a deployment of over 65% and British Sky Broadcasting over 86%.

    Internet of Thing (IoT)
        - The internet of today is significantly different than the internet of past decades. The internet of today is more than email, web pages, and file transfers between computers. The evolving internet is becoming an Internet of Things (IoT). No longer will the only devices accessing the internet be computers, tablets, and smartphones. The sensor-equipped, internet-ready devices of tomorrow will include everything from automobiles and biomedical devices, to household appliances and natural ecosystems.

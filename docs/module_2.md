### Module 2: Network Components, Types and Connections

## Client and Server
# Client and Server Roles
- All computers connected to a network that participate directly in network communications are classified as hosts.
  Hosts can send and receive messages on the network. In modern networks, computer hosts can act as a client, a server, or both.
  The software installed on the computer determines which role the computer plays.

- Servers are hosts that habe software installed which enables them to provide information, like email or webpages, to other hosts on the network.
  Each service requires separate server software.

# Peer-to-Peer Networks(P2P networks)
- In small businesses and homes, many computers function as the servers and clients on the network, This type of network is called a
  P2P network.
- The simplest P2P network consists of two directly connected computers using eihter a wired or wireless connection. Both computers are then able to use this simple network to
  exchange data and services with each other, acting as either a client or a server as necessary. Multiple PCs can also be connected to create a larger P2P network, but this
  requires a network devices, such as a switch, to interconnect the computers.
- The advantages:
  - Easy to set up
  - Less complex
  - Lower cost because network devices and dedicated servers may not be required
  - Can be used for simple tasks such as transferring files and sharing printers

- The disadvantages:
  - No centralized administration
  - Not as secure
  - Not scalable
  - All devices may act as both clients and servers which can slow down performances

# Peer-to-Peer Applications
- Allows a device to act as both a client and a server within the same communications. P2P applications require that each end device to provide a user interface and run a background service.
- Some P2P applications use a hybrid system where resource sharing is decentralized, but the indexes that point to resource locations are stored in a centralized directory.
  In a hybrid system, each peer accesses an index server to get the location of a resource stored on another peer.

# Multiple Roles in the Network
- A single computer can run multiple types of server software. In a home or small business, it may be necessary for one computer to act as a file server, a web server, and an 
  email server.
- A single computer can also run multiple types of client software. There must be client software for every service required. With multiple clients installed, a host can connect
  to multiple servers at the same time.

## Network Components
# Network Infrastructure
- The network infrastructure contains three categories of hardware components,
  - End devices
    - Desktop Computer
    - Laptop
    - Printer
    - IP Phone
    - Wireless Tablet
    - TelePresence Endpoint
  
  - Intermediate devices
    - Wireless Router
    - LAN Switch
    - Router
    - Multilayer Switch
    - Firewall Appliance
  
  - Network media
    - Wireless Media
    - LAN Media
    - WAN Media

- Devices and media are the physical elements, or hardware, of the network. Hardware is often the visible components of the network
  platform such as a laptop, PC, switch, router, wireless access point, or the cabling used to connect the devices. Occasionally, some components may not be so visible. In the case of wireless media, messages are transmitted through the air using invisible radio frequencies or infrared waves.

# End Devices
- The network devices that people are most familiar with are called end devices, or hosts. These devices form the interface between
  users and the underlying communication network.
  - Some examples:
    - Computers (workstatins, laptops, file servers, web servers)
    - Network printers
    - Telephones and teleconferencing equipment
    - Security cameras
    - Mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, PDAs and wireless debit/credit card readers and barcode scanners)

- An end device (or host) is either the source or destination of a message transmitted over the network. In order to uniquely identify
  hosts, addresses are used. When a host initiates communication, it uses the address of the destination host to specify where the message should be sent.

## ISP (Internet Service Provider) Connectivity Options
# ISP services
- ISP provides the link between the home network and the internet. An ISP can be the local cableprovider, a landline telephone service
  provider, the cellular network that provides your smartphone service, or an independent provider who leases bandwidth on the physical network infrastructure of another company.

- ISPs are critical to communications across the global internet. Each ISP connects to other ISPs to form a network of links that
  interconnect users all over the world. ISPs are connected in a hierarchical manner that ensures that internet traffic generally takes the shortest path from the source to the destination

- The internet backbone is like an information super highway that provides high-speed data links to connect the various service
  provider networks in major metropolitan areas around the world. The primary medium that connects the internet backbone is fiber-optic cable. This cable is typically installed underground to connect cities within continents. Fiber-optic cables also run under the sea to connect continents, countries, and cities.

# ISP Connections
- The interconnection of ISPs that forms the backbone of the internet is a complex web of fiber-optic cables with expensive networking 
  switches and routers that direct the flow of information between source and destination hosts. Average home users are not aware of the infrastructure outside of their network. For a home user, connecting to the ISP is a fairly uncomplicated process.

# Cables and DSL Connections
- Most home network users do not connect to their service providers with fiber-optic cables. The two most common methods are:
  - Cable: Typically offered by cable television service providers, the internet data signal is carried on the same coaxial cable that 
    delivers cable television. It provides a high bandwidth, always on, connection to the internet. A special cable modem separates the
    internet data signal from the other signals carried on the cable and provides an Ethernet connection to a host computer or LAN.

  - DSL (Digital Subscriber Line): Provides a high bandwidth, always on, connection to the internet. It requires a special high-speed 
    modem that separates the DSL signal from the telephone signal and provides the Ethernet connection to a host computer or LAN. DSL 
    runs over a telephone line, with the line split into three channels. One channel is used for voice telephone calls. This allows 
    an individual to receive phone calls without disconnecting from the internet. A second channel is a faster download channel, used 
    to receive information from the internet. The third channel is used for sending or uploading information. This channel is usually slightly slower than the download channel. The quality and speed of the DSL connection depends mainly on the quality of the phone line and the distance from the central office of your phone company. The further you are from the central office, the slower the connection.

# Additional Connetivity Options (for home users)
- Cellular
  - Cellular internet access uses a cell phone network to connect. Wherever you can get a cellular signal, you can get cellular
    internet access. Performance will be limited by the capabilities of the phone and the cell tower to which it is connected. The availability of cellular internet access is a real benefit for people in areas that would otherwise have no internet connectivity at all, or for people who are constantly on the move. The downside of cellular connectivity is that the carrier usually meters the bandwidth usage of the connection and may charge extra for bandwidth that exceeds the contract data plan.

- Satellite
  - Satellite service is a good option for homes or offices that do not have access to DSL or cable. Satellite dishes requires a clear 
    line of sight to the satellite and so might be difficult in heavily wooded areas or places with other overhead obstructions. Speeds will vary depending on the contract, though they are generally good. Equipment and installation costs can be high (although check the provider for special deals), with a moderate monthly fee thereafter, Like cellular access, the availability of satellite internet access is a real benefit in areas that would otherwise have no internet connectivity at all.

- Dial-up Telephone
  - An inexpensive option that uses any phone line and a modem. To connect to the ISP, a user calls the ISP access phone number. The 
    low bandwidth provided by a dial-up modem connection is usually not sufficient for large data transfer, although it is useful for
    mobile access while traveling. A modem dial-up connection should only be considered when higher speed connection options are not
    available.

### Module 2: Network Components, Types and Connections

## Client and Server
# Client and Server Roles
- All computers connected to a network that participate directly in network communications are classified as hosts.
  Hosts can send and receive messages on the network. In modern networks, computer hosts can act as a client, a server, or both.
  The software installed on the computer determines which role the computer plays.

- Servers are hosts that habe software installed which enables them to provide information, like email or webpages, to other hosts on the network.
  Each service requires separate server software.

# Peer-to-Peer Networks(P2P networks)
- In small businesses and homes, many computers function as the servers and clients on the network, This type of network is called a
  P2P network.
- The simplest P2P network consists of two directly connected computers using eihter a wired or wireless connection. Both computers are then able to use this simple network to
  exchange data and services with each other, acting as either a client or a server as necessary. Multiple PCs can also be connected to create a larger P2P network, but this
  requires a network devices, such as a switch, to interconnect the computers.
- The advantages:
  - Easy to set up
  - Less complex
  - Lower cost because network devices and dedicated servers may not be required
  - Can be used for simple tasks such as transferring files and sharing printers

- The disadvantages:
  - No centralized administration
  - Not as secure
  - Not scalable
  - All devices may act as both clients and servers which can slow down performances

# Peer-to-Peer Applications
- Allows a device to act as both a client and a server within the same communications. P2P applications require that each end device to provide a user interface and run a background service.
- Some P2P applications use a hybrid system where resource sharing is decentralized, but the indexes that point to resource locations are stored in a centralized directory.
  In a hybrid system, each peer accesses an index server to get the location of a resource stored on another peer.

# Multiple Roles in the Network
- A single computer can run multiple types of server software. In a home or small business, it may be necessary for one computer to act as a file server, a web server, and an 
  email server.
- A single computer can also run multiple types of client software. There must be client software for every service required. With multiple clients installed, a host can connect
  to multiple servers at the same time.

### The Arp Process

## Mac and IP
# Destination on Same Network
    Sometimes a host must send a message, but it only knows the IP address of the destination device. The host needs to know the MAC address of that device, but how can it be discovered? That is where address resolution becomes critical.
    There are two primary addresses assigned to a device on an Ethernet LAN:

        Physical address(the MAC address)
            Used for NIC-to-NIC communications on the same Ethernet network
        Logical address(the IP address)
            Used to send the packet from the source device to the destination device. The destination IP address may be on the same IP network as the source, or it may be on a remote network

    Layer 2 physical address (i.e., Ethernet MAC addresses) are used to deliver the data link frame with the encapsulated IP packet from one NIC to another NIC that is on the same network. If the destination IP address is on the same network, the destination MAC address will be that of the destination device.

# Destination on Remote Network
    When the destionation IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) is on a remote network, the destination MAC address will be the address of the host default gateway (i.e., the router interface).
        Examples:
            PC1 wants to send a packet to PC2. PC2 is located on remote network. Because the destination IPv4 address is not on the same local network as PC1, the destination MAC address is that of the local default gateway on the router.
            Routers examine the destination IPv4 address to determine the best path to forward the IPv4 packet. When the router receives the Ethernet frame, it de-encapsulates the Layer 2 information. Using the destination IPv4 address, it determines the next-hop device, and then encapsulates the IPv4 packet in a new data link frame for the outgoing interface.
            The host router would then encapsulate the packet with new Layer 2 address information.
            In the example below:

                ![Remote Network](images/destOnRemote.png)

                R1 would now encapsulate the packet with new Layer 2 address information, as show in the figure above.
                The new destination MAC address would be that of the R2 GO/0/1 interface and the new source MAC address would be that of the R1 GO/0/1 interface.

                Along each link in a path, an IP packet is encapsulated in a frame. The frame is specific to the data link technology that is associated with that link, such as Ethernet. If the next-hop device is the final destination, the destination MAC address will be that of the device Ethernet NIC.

    NOTE: Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used to determine the device MAC address of a known destination device IPv4 address. Neighbor Discovery (NP) is used to determine the MAC address of a known destination device IPv6 address.

## Broadcast Containment
# Ethernet Braodcast
    An Ethernet Broadcast is when the destination MAC address is 48 one-bits, or in hexadecimal, all FS.
        Example:
            In a SOHO network with 2 switches, and each switches have 4 PCs. Switch A have a new PC labelled as PC4. PC4 is going to send a broadcast to all other devices. This might be a message that it needs all the devices in its network to receive. When a switch receives an Ethernet broadcast, it floods, or forwards, the Ethernet frame out all ports except the incoming port. The result is, all the devices in the network will receive the broadcast. If the SOHO have a router in the network, it will receive the broadcast also. However the router wil not forward the broadcast on to other network.

# Broadcast Domains
    When a host receives a message addressed to the broadcast address, it accepts and processes the message as though the message was addressed directly to it. When a host sends a broadcast message, switches forward the message to every connected host within the same local network. For this reason, a local area network, a network with one or more Ethernet switches, is also referred to as a broadcast domain.
    If too many hosts are connected to the same broadcast domain, a broadcast traffic can become excessive. The number of hosts and the amount of network traffic that can be supported on the local network is limited by the capabilities of the switches used to connect them. As the network grows and more hosts are added, network traffic, including broadcast traffic, increases. To improve performance, it is necessary to divide one local network into multiple networks, or broadcast domains. Routers are used to divide the network into multiple broadcast domains.

# Access Layer Communication
    On a local Ethernet network, a NIC(Network Interface Card) only accepts a frame if the destination address is either the broadcast MAC address, or else corresponds to the MAC address of the NIC.
    Most network applications, however, rely on the logical destination IP address to identify the location of the servers and clients. If the sending host only has the logical IP address of the destination host, it can use an IPv4 protocol called address resolution protocol (ARP) to discover the MAC address of any host on the same local network. IPv6 uses a similar method knows as Neighbor Discovery (ND).

# Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
    ARP uses a three step process to discover and store the MAC address of a host on the local network when only the IPv4 address of the host is knows:

        1. The sending host creates and sends a frame addressed to a broadcast MAC address. Containted in the frame is a message with the IPv4 address of the intended destination host.
        2. Each host on the network receives the broadcast frame and compares the IPv4 address inside the message with its configured IPv4 address. The host with the matching IPv4 address sends its MAC address back to the original sending host.
        3. The sending host receives the message and stores the MAC address and IPv4 address information in a table called an ARP table.

    When the sending host has the MAC address of the destination host in its ARP table, it can send frames directly to the destination without doing an ARP request. Because ARP messages rely on broadcast frames to deliver the requests, all hosts in the local IP4 network must be in the same broadcast domain.

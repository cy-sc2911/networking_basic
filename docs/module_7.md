# Encapsulation
    - The process of placing one message format (the letter) inside another message format (the envelope) is called encapsulation. De-encapsulation occurs when the process is reversed by the recipient and the letter is removed from the envelop. Just as a letter is encapsulated in an envelope for delivery, so computer messages are encapsulated.
    - Each computer message is encapsulated in a specific format, called a frame, before it is sent over the network. A frame acts like an envelope; it provides the address of the intended destination and the address of the source host. The forat and the contents of a frame are determined by the type of message being send and the channel over which it is communicated. Messages that are not correctly formatted are not successfully delivered to or processed by the destination host.

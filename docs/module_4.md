# Components of a Home Network
- In addition to an integrated router, there are many different types od devices that might be connecting to a home network. Examples:
    - Desktop computers
    - Gaming systems
    - Smart TV systems
    - Printers
    - Scanners
    - Security cameras
    - Telephones

- Typical Home Network Routers
    - Small business and home routers typically have two primary types of ports:
        - Ethernet Ports
            - These ports connect to the internal switch portion of the router. These ports are usually labled "Eternet" or "LAN". All
                devices are connected to the switch ports are on the same local network.
        - Internet Ports
            - This port is used to connect the device to another network. The internet port connects the router to a different network
                than the Ethernet ports. This port is often used to connect to the cable or DSL modem in order to access the internet.
    - In addition to the wired ports, many home routers include a radio antenna and a built-in wireless access point. By default, the wireless devices are on the same local network as the devices that are physically plugged into the LAN switch ports. The internet port is the only port that is on a different network in the default configuration.

## Network Technologies in the Home
# LAN Wireless Frequencies
- The wireless technologies most frequently used in home networks are in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency ranges.
- Bluetooth is a technology that makes use of the 2.4 GHz band. It is limited to low-speed, short-range communications, but has the
    advantage of communicating with many devices at the same time. This one-to-many communication has made Bluetooth tech the perferred method for connecting computer perpherals such as wireless mice, keyboards and printers. Bluetooth is a good method for transmitting audio to speakers or headphones.
- Other techs that use the 2.4 GHz and 5 GH bands are the modern wireless LAN techs that conform to the various IEEE 802.11 standards.
    Unlike bluetooth tech, 802.11 devices transmit at a mch higher power level giving them a great range and improved throughput. Certain
    areas of the electromagnetic spectrum can be used without a permit.

# Wired Network Technologies
- The most common implemented wired protocol is the Ethernet protocol. Ethernet uses a suite of protocols that allow network devices to
    communicate over a wired LAN connection. An Ethernet LAN can connect devices using many different types of wiring media.
- Directly connected devices use an Ethernet patch cable, usually unshielded twisted pair. These cables can be purchased with the RJ-45
    connectors already installed, and they come in various lengths.
- Category 5e cable
    - The most common wiring used in a LAN. The cable is made up of four pairs of wires that are twisted to reduce electrical interference.
- Coaxial cable
    - Has an inner wire surrounded by a tubular insulating later, that is then surrounded by a tubular conducting shield. Most coax
    cables also have an external insulating sheath or jacket.
- Fiber-Optic cable
    - FIber-optic cables can be either glass or plastic with a diameter about the same as a human hair and it can carry digital information at a very high speeds over long distances. Fiber-optic cables have a very high bandwidth, which enables them to carry very large amounts of data.

## Wireless Standards
# Wi-Fi Networks
- The main organization responsible for the creation of wireless technical standards is the Institue of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).
- The IEEE 802.11 standard governs the WLAN environment. There are amendments to the IEEE 802.11 standard that describe characteristics for different standards of wireless communications. Wireless standards for LANs use the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands. Collectively these technologies are referred to as Wi-Fi.
- Another organization, knows as the Wi-Fi Alliance, is responsible for testing wireless LAN devices from different manufacturers. The Wi-Fi logo on a device means that this equipment meets standards and should operate with other devices that use the same standard.

# Wireless Settings
- Network mode
    - Determines the type of technology that must be supported. For example, 802.11b, 801.11g, 201.11n or Mixed Mode.

- Network Name (SSID - Service Set Identifier)
    - Used to identify the WLAN. All devices that wish to participate in the WLAN must have the same SSID.

- Standard Channel
    - Specifies the channel over which communication will occur. By default, this is set to Auto to allow the access point(AP) to determine the optimum channel to use.

- SSID Broadcast
    - Determines if the SSID will be broadcast to all devices within range. By default, set to Enabled.

- Network Mode
    - The 802.11 protocol can provide increased throughput based on the wireless network environment. If all wireless devices connect with the same 802.11 standard, maximum speeds can be obtained for that standard. If the access point is configured to accept only one 802.11 standard, devices that do not use that standard cannot connect to the access point.
    - A mixed mode wireless network environment can include devices that use any of the existing Wi-Fi standards. This environment provides easy access for older devices that need wireless connection but do not support the latest standards.

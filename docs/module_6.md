### NETWORK MEDIA
## Network Media Types
# Three Media Types
- Data is transmitted across a network on media. The media provides the channel over which the message travels from source to destination.
- Modern network primarily use three tyoes of media to interconnect devices.
    - Metal wires within cables
        - Data is encoded into electrical impulses
    - Glass or plastic fibers within cables (fiber-optic cable)
        - Data is encoded into pulses of light
    - Wireless transmission
        - Data is encoded via modulation of specific frequencies of electromagnetic waves

- The four main criteria for choosing network media are these:
    - What is the maximum distance that the media can successfully carry a signal?
    - What is the environment in which the media will be installed?
    - What is the amount of data and at what speed must it be transmitted?
    - What is the cost of the media and installation?
